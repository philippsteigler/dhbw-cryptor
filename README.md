# cryptor
Encrypt files and hide them in pictures - for secure message exchange.

This tool let's you encrypt any type of file using secure AES cryptographic algorithm.
Your file is then encoded into a PNG picture of choise which allows for private and secret message transfer.
The receiver of your message is then able to extract the hidden file and decrypt it for further use - provided that the correct AES-key was used.
In order to do so, cryptor implements well-known and secure Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol.
Exchange keys between two parties for strong AES encrption.
